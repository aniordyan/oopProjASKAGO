CS120 project of Karine Grigoryan, Ani Ordyan, Araksya Sedrakyan

We are making an audio player, which enables users to interact with songs and podcasts.
User can get the list of all songs, get the playlists of songs, add and delete a song. 
Currently, the song functionality is almost done, the podcast is in progress.


Please note that our project has two branches master and main. Master contains the code for Java Swing, while main is for JavaFX. Main branch contains the final version of our project
