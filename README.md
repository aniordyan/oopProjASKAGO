CS120 project of Karine Grigoryan, Ani Ordyan, Araksya Sedrakyan

We are making an audio player, which enables users to interact with songs and podcasts.
Please note that our project has two branches master and main. Master contains the code for Java Swing, while main is for JavaFX. Main branch contains the final version of our project. We made two branches to escape merging errors.
